Abstract:
The "IoT – Aquaculture and Monitoring" project focuses on creating a prototype of a smart aquaculture monitoring system that enables real-time water quality monitoring using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This system is critical for fish farming and other aquaculture environments, where maintaining optimal water quality is vital for the health and productivity of aquatic organisms. Using Arduino and potentiometers to simulate key sensors, this prototype successfully models the behavior of a real-time monitoring system. The monitored parameters include pH level, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia concentration, and water level. These data points are continuously evaluated, and alerts are generated based on predefined thresholds to signify when corrective actions are required. This phase documents the demonstration, feedback refinement, final testing, and preparation for project handover.

1. Project Demonstration
Overview:
The demonstration phase was designed to validate the functional performance of the simulated aquaculture monitoring system. It involved showcasing how the system detects water quality issues and provides real-time feedback. The core hardware includes an Arduino Uno microcontroller and multiple potentiometers simulating sensor values. This simulation represents an abstraction of a deployable IoT system that can be scaled with actual sensors and wireless transmission modules.
Demonstration Details:

o	Dissolved Oxygen Sensor (A2): Mapped to 0–100% DO levels.
o	Ammonia Sensor (A5): Mapped to 0–100% concentration. Safe: < 5%, Dangerous: > 50%.
o	Water Level (A4): Simulated via potentiometer mapped to a 0–50 cm scale.
•	Output and Alerts:
o	Serial monitor outputs status updates per second.
